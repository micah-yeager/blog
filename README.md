# Personal site & blog

This project is the source for my personal site and blog, built with the
following technologies:

- [Remix](https://remix.run/)
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Development

To run locally, make sure the project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
pnpm install
```

Afterwards, start the Remix development server:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to
go!

## Deploy Your Own

Deployment can be done using the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli):

```sh
pnpm i -g vercel
vercel
```

> [!IMPORTANT] Vercel should be installed globally, not locally.
