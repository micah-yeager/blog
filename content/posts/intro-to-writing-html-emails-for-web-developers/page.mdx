Writing and styling HTML emails has always been a giant pain in the ass. There
are no "standards" for what markup and styles are supported among the multitude
of email clients out there, so it's a minefield of figuring out what will work
and what won't.

Below is a crash-course on how to avoid common pitfalls and create emails that
both look good and display consistently for your recipients. I'll be assuming
that you're already familiar with the basics of web development.

## A brief ~~rant~~ history

The current, horrific state of email markup can't be blamed on any one person or
company — the fact that
[_no_ email client supports the full HTML / CSS spec](https://www.caniemail.com/scoreboard/)
is a pretty clear indicator of that. That being said, Microsoft's Outlook 2007
is really where things started to go south. This set the closest thing a
"standard" that email will likely get for the foreseeable future for email
clients, given Microsoft's ubiquity within the business world.

That's because, starting with Outlook 2007,
[the HTML / CSS rendering engine is the same that powers _Microsoft Word_](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/email-client/outlook-2007-16/)(!),
which has pretty terrible support for CSS. What's worse, even at the time this
was clearly downgrade from Outlook 2003, which used Internet Explorer's
rendering engine. Which, you know, was actually built for web content.

In true Microsoft fashion, instead of learning from their mistake, Microsoft
doubled-down and continued using Word as the rendering engine until (checks
notes)... oh, it's still being used even in Outlook 2021. Things are _starting_
to look better: Microsoft's "new Outlook" (which started rolling out in
late 2023)
[finally gets rid of Word as the rendering engine](https://www.emailonacid.com/blog/article/industry-news/new-outlook-for-windows/),
and instead seems to be mainly taking
[inspiration from Outlook on the Web](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/outlook/overview-new-outlook#architecture).

This is a huge step back to normalcy, and this hopefully will lead to the
majority of this article being obsolete in a few years — Microsoft has
end-of-support for Outlook 2021 marked for
[October 2026](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/?terms=Outlook).
I'm not holding my breath, though, since the precedent that Microsoft set with
Outlook 2007 can still be seen in other email clients.

## Some basics

### What counts as an "email client"?

The obvious answer would be "a desktop application to view emails", but that's
only partially correct. Email providers often provide their own web-based method
of viewing emails (e.g. Gmail, Outlook on the Web, GoDaddy, etc.), and even
those have varying degrees of support for the full HTML / CSS specification.

These aren't just minor divergences from the HTML and CSS specs, either. For
example, `style` tags are stripped out of the email body
([Gmail](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/email-client/gmail/) /
[G Suite](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/email-client/g-suite/)) or are
removed entirely
([AOL Mail](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/email-client/aol-mail/), which
still had
[1.5 million paying users in 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/03/aol-1point5-million-people-still-pay-for-service-but-not-for-dial-up-internet.html)).

### How can I find out what's supported?

When creating emails, I basically have two resources open at all times:

- [Campaign Monitor's CSS Support Guide](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/)
- [Can I email...?](https://www.caniemail.com/)

The two of these together will give you a pretty good idea of what's supported
and what isn't by each email client. The former is a bit more detailed, but the
latter is more up-to-date.

Additionally, GitHub user
[seanpowell created a solid boilerplate](https://github.com/seanpowell/Email-Boilerplate/blob/master/email_min.html)
that implements several best practices, as well as resets some email
client-specific styles that can get in the way of your design process.

## General tips

### Please for the love of god test your emails everywhere you can

This is the most important tip I can give. Don't assume that what looks good in
a browser or a single email client will look remotely similar in another.

You can use services like [Email on Acid](https://www.emailonacid.com/),
[Litmus](https://www.litmus.com/), [https://testi.at/](https://testi.at/), etc.
to do these tests for you, but if you're working small-scale (e.g. a single
custom email, or an email signature) or are on a budget, there's absolutely
nothing wrong with sending test emails to yourself and opening them in as many
clients as you can.

At minimum, you should be testing in:

- Outlook (any version from 2007 to 2021)
- "new" Outlook
- Outlook's mobile app
- Gmail

And if you can, also test in:

- Apple Mail
- Outlook for Mac

### "Code like it's 1999"

This is a common joke among email developers, but it still holds true.
[The more you can stick to the HTML 4.01 spec, the better](<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/developer/office-2007/aa338201(v=office.12)?redirectedfrom=MSDN#supported-html-elements-attributes-and-cascading-style-sheet-properties>).
Effectively, this means no modern HTML tags or CSS properties, and styles should
be converted to attributes wherever applicable.

For example, instead of this:

```html
<img src="https://cataas.com/cat?type=square" alt="A picture of a cat" />
<hr />
```

you'd be better off with this:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```html
<img
  src="https://cataas.com/cat?type=square"
  alt="A picture of a cat"
  height="48"
  width="48"
/>
<hr>
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Notice that the `width` and `height` CSS properties were converted to pixels and
moved to HTML attributes —
[Outlook 2007–2023 has only support for the CSS property some tags](https://www.caniemail.com/features/css-height/).
Additionally, we replaced the self-closing `hr` tag with an "open" one; this
isn't good HTML 5, but it _is_ valid HTML 4 (good luck getting your IDE to not
try to automatically add the closing slash).

### Use `table`s when alignment matters, not `div`s

This is probably the most important, non-obvious rule. Tables are essentially
the **only** way to ensure consistent alignment and spacing in any context. So,
instead of this:

```html
<div>
  <div style="display: inline-block; width: 100px; height: 100px;">
    First item
  </div>
  <div style="display: inline-block; width: 100px; height: 100px;">
    Second item
  </div>
</div>
```

do something like this instead:

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="width: 100px; height: 100px;">First item</td>
    <td style="width: 100px; height: 100px;">Second item</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

Notice that we lose some of the responsiveness that we're used to with `div`s —
the two elements will always be side-by-side, regardless of the width of the
viewport. This will be a common theme — consistency at the cost of flexibility.

### Use inline styles, not CSS classes

This is likely the biggest pain point for web developers. The final,
"production" build of an email should use inline styles due to
[inconsistencies with how email clients handle `style` tags](https://www.caniemail.com/features/html-style/).
This means, however, that things like media queries and pseudo-selectors become
impossible to use (although [support](https://www.caniemail.com/search/?s=%3A)
for [them](https://www.caniemail.com/search/?s=%40) was already spotty at best
to begin with).

The easiest way to handle this is using classes like normal during development,
and use a post-processing tool to convert everything to inline styles, which
will convert this:

```html
<head>
  <style>
    .red {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p class="red">This text will be red</p>
</body>
```

to this automatically:

```html
<body>
  <p style="color: red;">This text will be red</p>
</body>
```

This, of course, gets tricky when combined with the **"Code like it's 1999"**
section above and dealing with HTML attributes. This leads me into my
penultimate tip:

### Use a build tool purpose-built for email

There are a few tools out there that are specifically designed to make writing
easier. I love using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for web
development, and it turns out that a tool called [Maizzle](https://maizzle.com)
has been created to allow you to use it in emails as well!

In addition to having the ability to convert classes to inline styles, Maizzle
also has a component system that allows you to create reusable components and
abstract repetitive code. This allows for this:

```html
<body>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td style="padding: 10px;">
        <h1>I've come to make an announcement!</h1>
        <p>[redacted]</p>
        <img
          src="https://cataas.com/cat?type=square"
          alt="A picture of a cat"
          height="48"
          width="48"
        />
        <img
          src="https://cataas.com/cat?type=square"
          alt="A picture of a cat"
          height="26"
          width="26"
        />
        <img
          src="https://cataas.com/cat?type=square"
          alt="A picture of a cat"
          height="86"
          width="86"
        />
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</body>
```

into something a bit more manageable:

```html
<body>
  <x-content>
    <h1>I've come to make an announcement!</h1>
    <p>[redacted]</p>
    <x-cat-image size="48" />
    <x-cat-image size="26" />
    <x-cat-image size="86" />
  </x-content>
</body>
```

### Don't be afraid to use Outlook-specific workarounds

Finally, given how restrictive Outlook is, there is absolutely nothing wrong
with targeting all other email clients first, then using Outlook-specific styles
to fill any gaps. This is done in two ways:

1. [Outlook-specific CSS properties](https://stigmortenmyre.no/mso/html/concepts/ofconstyletable.htm)
   — some important ones:
   - `mso-line-height-rule`:
     - `exactly`: prevents Outlook from overriding line-height to `20px` on `td`
       and `img` tags.
     - `at-least` (default): allows the line-height to grow vertically to fit
       content, e.g. images.
   - `mso-line-height-alt`: since
     [Outlook's support for the `line-height` property isn't great](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/text-fonts/line-height/),
     use this property in addition to the normal property, e.g.
     `line-height: 12px; mso-line-height-alt: 12px;`.
   - `mso-table-lspace` / `mso-table-rspace`: set to `0pt` on `table` tags in
     your reset stylesheet to remove Outlook's unique table spacing.
   - `-ms-interpolation-mode`: when set to `bicubic` on `img` tags, makes images
     display much more cleanly if it's not displayed at the image's native size.
     Helpful in Internet Explorer and Outlook 2003 and earlier.
2. [Outlook conditional comments](https://stackoverflow.design/email/base/mso/)
   — the most important statement is
   `<!--[if mso]> Outlook-specific code <![endif]-->`, which allows us to define
   Outlook-specific HTML that's ignored in all other clients. This is incredibly
   powerful, but can lead to duplicate or hard-to-manage code if overused — use
   it when nothing else is working.

## Final thoughts

Writing HTML emails is a pain, but it's a necessary evil (for now). Hopefully
this has been a helpful crash-course on how to avoid common pitfalls and point
you in the right direction! Once you get a grasp of the general things to watch
out for, you'll be able to pump out emails in no time.
